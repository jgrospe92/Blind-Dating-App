# Blind-Dating-App
 Academic Project for Application Development Course

# Description
This project demonstrates our proficiency in C# language, design pattern and  windows form. It also demonstrates our creativity in designing layouts. We implement json to store and retrieve the data. The app offers internalization up to 4 languages.
Our goal for this app is to guaranteed users the chance to find partners or potential long time relationships. Similar to other dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge. We encourage people to start and initiate conversations online and then go on dates in real life.

# App Features
## User Registration
New user will have to fill in the form in order for them to show up in the database. Every new user will scale the database.
## User Login
After registration, the user can login using their username and password. We implement invalid credentials to verify the user credentials.
## Gender Limitation
We eliminate the gender limitation, we want this app to be free and accessible for everyone. No separation of gender, our algorithm does not check for gender but rather users interests. All users are able to accept or decline a match up.
## Friendly UI 
At the current development, we want to keep it simple and functional.
## Match notification
You will be informed when your profiles matches with other people. You can accept or decline the match up.
## User Profile
Each user will have to build their own profile and add their own photo and short info about themselves.
**IMPORTANT** Currently, adding your own photo is not yet available.
## Report
If you find someone that is suspicious or has a malicious intent. You can report that user. 
## Scalability
It automatically populate the database every time a new user register. There is no limit, the database will grow as long as people are registering.

# How does the matching works?
We simply use a match making algorithm. It takes the user likes or interest and look through the database and check for each user traits or characters. If that user has something in common it will add that into a list and return that list. It will then display it on the GUI as matched users.
